# Rolling Volatility Analysis and Linear Regression

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing rolling volatility trends for financial datasets, with a particular emphasis on specific firms and notable events (e.g., announcement dates). The project also introduces linear regression as a method for understanding relationships within financial data.

## Objectives
- **Rolling Volatility Analysis**: To measure and visualize the volatility trends of stock prices over time, using a 20-day rolling window.
- **Event Impact Analysis**: Highlight specific dates of announcements and assess their potential impact on stock volatility.
- **Linear Regression**: Employ regression analysis to uncover relationships and potential predictors of financial metrics.

## Methodology

### Data Preparation
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation.
  - `NumPy` for numerical operations.
  - `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` for data visualization.
- **Data Cleaning**: Ensuring the dataset is free of missing values and prepared for analysis.

### Rolling Volatility Analysis
1. **Calculation**:
   - Rolling volatility is computed using a 20-day rolling window.
   - Focused analysis on specific firms (e.g., Amazon - AMZN).

2. **Visualization**:
   - Rolling volatility is plotted against time for each firm.
   - Announcement dates are highlighted with vertical dashed lines for better insights.

3. **Insights**:
   - Trends and spikes in volatility are observed and correlated with significant events or announcements.

### Linear Regression
- Placeholder for linear regression implementation.
- Objective: To build a regression model to predict volatility or other financial outcomes based on explanatory variables.

## Visualizations
- **Rolling Volatility Over Time**:
  - Includes a line plot of rolling volatility.
  - Key events  are marked for contextual understanding.

## How to Run the Notebook
1. **Dependencies**:
   - Install Python libraries: `pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`.
   - Ensure the dataset is in the correct format and accessible.
2. **Execution**:
   - Open the notebook in Jupyter or any compatible environment.
   - Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

## Next Steps
- Complete the linear regression section to enhance predictive insights.
- Expand the analysis to include multiple firms or additional financial metrics.
- Investigate the causal relationship between announcements and volatility changes.

## Deliverables
- A detailed analysis of rolling volatility.
- Interactive visualizations highlighting trends and events.
- A regression model to predict financial outcomes (to be implemented).
